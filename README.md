# TutorialMaker-ossproject
### Do you want to be a lecturer?
First of all, users of this program are divided into two types. The person who produces and distributes Tutorial is called the creator, and the person who downloads and learns Tutorial is called the learner.

Tutorial Maker is literally a program that can produce tutorials.
Different code descriptions allow creators to create "Tutorials" in the form of files that are more understandable to learners.

When studying programming, using existing services such as blogs, gitbooks, etc.,
Learners understand because content must be delivered only with code and annotations
It can be difficult. Tutorial Maker deviates from this way of explaining.
Attach video annotations, image annotations, and voice annotations.
In addition, for Tutorial for training, you can put in quizzes and steps to help learners take quizzes.
You can learn by solving it or following the steps set by the producer one by one.
