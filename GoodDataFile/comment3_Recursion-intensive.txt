intensive1. Counting Cells in a Blob
-Binary image is given as input.
-Each pixel is either a background pixel (white) or an image pixel (blue).
-A set of interconnected image pixels is called Blob.
-Also connected in top-to-bottom, left-right and diagonal directions are 
  considered Blob.

Therefore, the following Blob sets exist in the figure above.
There are four blobs in total.

Recursive Thinking
To count the size of the blob to which the current pixel belongs

If the current pixel is not an image color,

Returns zero.

If the current pixel is an image color,

First, count the current pixel (count=1)

It is painted in a different color to prevent the current pixel from being 
over-counted.

For every pixel adjacent to the current pixel (8 pixels)

Count the size of the Blob to which the pixel belongs and add it to the counter.

Returns the counter.
