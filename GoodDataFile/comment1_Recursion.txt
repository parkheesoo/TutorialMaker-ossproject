The first class recursion in the concept to explain.Iran easily said, 
'Recursion' is a function 'circulation', and recursion recursion.Recursion function
in every language c is mean the function that calls themselves.
I'll understand through the code.

However, if you use Recurrence like this, there will be a problem. 
There is no way out, so you keep calling yourself, and you end up
in an infinite loop. To solve this problem, Recurrence must make a way out.

If you make a way out, you can get the result you want without falling into 
an infinite loop. 
It's not just for this kind of output, it can do a lot of different things.
