Basic1. n square of x
Recurrence is mathematically perfectly organized.
 Assuming that recursionF(x, n) is a function that calculates 
the n-square of x, the next recall(x, n-1) is a function that calculates 
the n-1-square of x, so multiplying by x returns exactly the n-square value of x.

Basic2. Fibonacci
Fibonacci sequence problem starting from 1.
 As proof, assuming that recusionF(n) is a function of obtaining the nth 
Fibonacci number, the Fibonacci number adds the n-1st and n-2nd terms, 
so recusionF(n-1) + recusionF(n-2) is perfectly established.
