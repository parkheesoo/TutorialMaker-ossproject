Power Set - Powerset
Every subset of a set is called a power set.

Any subset of the set data = {a, b, c, d} can be found in the following order:

2©ú = 16.

List all subsets using Recurrence
To list all subsets of {a, b, c, d, e, f}

First, the subset that does not contain a.

It can be divided into subsets containing a.

Therefore, it can be expressed as follows.

Subset that does not contain a

List all subsets of {b, c, d, e, f} except a.

Subset containing a

Lists all subsets of {b, c, d, e, f} with {a}.

If the above two are combined, the number of cases is 2????.

If so, to list all subsets of {b, c, d, e, f} that have {a} added to them:

Once again, a subset that does not contain b.

It is divided into subsets containing b.

therefore

Subset that does not contain b

List all subsets of {c, d, e, f} with {a} added.

Subset containing b

Lists all subsets of {c, d, e, f} with {a, b}.

Again, to list all subsets of {c, d, e, f} with {a} added:

Lists all subsets of {d, e, f} with {a} added.

Lists the sets {a, c} added to all subsets of {d, e, and f}.
